buclose
_fd_

#include <jelio.h>

Use to cleanup the buffer connected to the filedescriptor _fd_. All remaining data in the buffer is lost.
If you reuse the fd for buffered input without calling buclose(_fd_) in between any data remaining unread in the input buffer will be applied to the new _fd_ coupling. If the input buffer was flagged as EOF this flag will also remain and you will not be able to read from the new _fd_ coupling.

Returns 0 on success and -1 on failure.
