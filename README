This is a proof of concept C stdio replacement library.

Its aim is not to provide new implementations of the exact same function calls.
But to provide similar functionality from an interface that permits efficient
static linking.

By separating the print formats into functions they will only be linked if they
are actually used by the program.

Yes, I know documentation is lacking although most of the functions should be
pretty self explaining due to the similarity with the C stdio.
The more advanced functions are slightly documented in the header files.

You can also look at the vtest.c file for some examples of usage.

jelio is a  C stdio replacement library.
The aim is to provide similar functionality as the C stdio functions from an interface that permits efficient static linking.
